Introduction
------------

**AMa_ChamferMaker** is a generator plugin that allows you to add  
beveled edges to any 3D object, procedural or polygonal, while  
keeping the object manager tree fully procedural. This means, you  
can get nice accentuated edges that will make your renders look  
much more realistic while keeping the power to change things after  
the fact.

It also has a few extra tricks under its sleeve for dealing with  
geometry a bit more complicated.

Installation
------------

Compile and install to CINEMA 4D's plugin folder  
(or the equivalent in the user preferences folder).

If you do not want to compile the plugin, you can find  
a pre-compiled binary distribution in the downloads  
section. The binary distribution also contains the  
pre-compiled Windows plugins that are floating around  
on the web for R12.


Basic Usage
-----------

Go to the *Plugins* menu, choose *AMa_ChamferMaker*.  
This will instantiate the generator object in the Object Manager.  

From hereon you can put the model objects you want bevelled under the  
generator object just as you would with any generator (e.g. a HyperNURBS).

In the generators Attribute Manager interface set the targeting mode  
and bevel away.
