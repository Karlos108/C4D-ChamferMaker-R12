Introduction
------------

*AMa_Chamfer_Maker* is a generator plugin that allows you to add
bevelled edges to any 3D object, procedural or polygonal, while
keeping the object manager tree fully procedural. This means, you
can get nice accentuated edges that will make your renders look 
much more realistic while keeping the power to change things after 
the fact.

It also has a few extra tricks under ist sleeve for dealing with 
geometry a bit more complicated.

Installation
------------

Compile and install to CINEMA 4D's plugin folder 
(or the equivalent in the user preferences folder).

If you do not want to compile the plugin, you can find
a pre-compiled binary distribution in the downloads
section.


Basic Usage
-----------

Go to the _Plugins_ menu, choose *AMa_Chamfer_Maker*.
This will instantiate the generator object in the Object Manager (OM).
From hereon you can put the model objects you want bevelled under the
generator object just as you would with any generator (e.g. a HyperNURBS).

In the generators Attribute Manager interface set the targeting mode
and bevel away.
